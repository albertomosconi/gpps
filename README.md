<h1 align="center">Google Privacy Page Skip</h1>

Skips the privacy page when opening Youtube or any Google page for the first time after having cleaned the browser's cache and cookies.

## Motivation

Due to privacy reasons I've setup my browser so that when its closed all cookies, cache, and history get deleted.

An annoying side-effect to this is that now whenever I reopen the browser and access a Google website a privacy policy page pops up.

With this extension, this page gets automatically skipped, saving me some clicks.

## Install

Follow the instructions below according to your browser.

### Firefox
