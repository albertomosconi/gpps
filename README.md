<h1 align="center">Google Privacy Page Skip</h1>

Skips the cookies page that Google redirects you to when visiting certain sites (like Maps) for the first time after having cleaned the browser's cache and cookies.

**! this extension doesn't stop the popup on Youtube or Google.com**

Follow the instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/albertomosconi/f8c39411d813e9e20c03ed481ce00da3) to learn how to handle the popup.

## Motivation

Due to privacy reasons I've setup my browser so that when its closed all cookies, cache, and history get deleted.

An annoying side-effect to this is that now whenever I reopen the browser and access a Google website like Maps I get redirected to a new page, asking for my consent to cookies.

With this extension, this page gets automatically skipped, saving me some clicks.

## Install

Follow the instructions below according to your browser.

### Firefox

[Visit this link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gpps/) and click on `Add to Firefox`
